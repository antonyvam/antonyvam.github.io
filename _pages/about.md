I am a **research engineer** developing **machine-learning methods for scientific imaging and inverse problems**.

I am the creator and lead developer of [nDTomo](https://github.com/ndtomo/ndtomo), an open-source platform for chemical imaging and tomography, and of the [Battery Imaging Library (BIL)](https://www.batteryimaginglibrary.com/), the first open-access, multi-modal and multi-length-scale imaging resource for battery research.

My work focuses on **physics-informed learning**, **GAN-based generative models for multimodal experimental data**, and the development of **deployable research software** used for industry and academia. I work primarily with experimental data from imaging and diffraction techniques, designing methods that prioritise physical consistency, robustness, and practical utility.

I have led and delivered **peer-reviewed research programmes** funded by **UKRI** and the **Royal Society** as technical lead and PI, translating research projects into working methods and software used in experimental workflows.
